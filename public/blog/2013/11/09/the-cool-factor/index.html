<div class="entry-content"><p>I often find myself wondering about and/or having conversations with others concerning the classic breadth vs depth decision. To explain, let&rsquo;s say you have 100 hours to learn some things &ndash; and you could choose either to:
&ndash; Learn 15 different things given these 100 hours, but all of them only to a relatively shallow degree
&ndash; Learn only 1 or 2 things with these 100 hours, but learning them to an extremely great depth</p>

<p>So, which would you choose? Especially working in the IT industry, one that changes particularly quickly (making information about it seem inherently transient), this question becomes notably interesting.</p>

<h3>The Answer:</h3>

<p>If you ask this question to almost anyone, in or outside of the IT industry, you&rsquo;ll likely get the same answer. Can you guess what it is?</p>

<!-- more -->


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A happy median between depth and breath!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;T-Shaped people, who are generalists amongst a wide array of skills but experts in only a few&rdquo;&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Or other such answers of similarly indescribable brilliance and specificity. Well, I think this answer is <strong>bullshit</strong>, and that, in most cases, it should be viewed as nothing less.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a valid and useful answer in the sense that it&rsquo;s an important thing to strive for &ndash; of course we want to make an attempt to achieve perfection. But, I feel it&rsquo;s a little bit like the president asking his chief economic advisor &ldquo;What should we do about balancing the budget&rdquo; and getting the response &ldquo;We should make sure we don&rsquo;t waste money on bad things, and spend it only on good things!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a nice idea but, how helpful is it, really?</p>

<p>So, let us put aside the obvious answer of &ldquo;be perfect&rdquo; and instead consider more realistic concerns.</p>

<h3>The Slightly Less Bullshit Answer</h3>

<p>To try and give a less bull-shitty answer, I will suggest the following.</p>

<p>In the IT industry, I believe there is an unspoken influence which places a stronger focus on depth than on breadth. I will also argue that I think this is wrong, and not only potentially dangerous to the industry as a whole, but in particular dangerous to consulting firms.</p>

<p>The reason I feel safe suggesting such a hard opinion is because I don&rsquo;t insult the general ideology of depth being &lsquo;better&rsquo; than breadth, but instead I insult the mechanism that I believe often causes this decision to be made. What I am referring to is:</p>

<h3>The Cool Factor</h3>

<p><img src="/images/don_draper_is_cool.png" alt="The Cool Factor" /></p>

<p>The cool factor can be explained with a simple example. Take two programming concepts:</p>

<p><strong><em>Concept A</em></strong>: Learning basic array manipulation in C, Java, Python, Ruby, and JavaScript</p>

<hr />

<p><strong><em>Concept B</em></strong>: Knowing C, or another pointer based programming language, well enough to use pointer arithmetic to alter the values of an array tersely</p>

<p><em>Concept A</em> is something about any programmer will know, iterating and manipulating arrays in a variety of ways, i.e.
&ndash; Mapping an array to add 1 to every element
&ndash; Initializing arrays with a set of values
&ndash; Iterating and selecting a particular element from an array.</p>

<p>This is a good idea. It&rsquo;s relatively simple, and has incredible utility with almost every aspect of programming.</p>

<p><em>Concept B</em> is something that fewer programmers know about. I also think we can safely this concept is much less useful than Concept A. It&rsquo;s a more complex idea, and it&rsquo;s likely you will run into this technique only after working with a pointer based language like C for a relatively long time.</p>

<p>Now &ndash; imagine you ask some fellow developer to tell you about some concept, any concept, concerning programming. What would be a &ldquo;cooler&rdquo; response?  If they responded with and explained Concept A, general of array manipulation, or Concept B, using pointer arithmetic to manipulate arrays? I think the answer is rather obvious, it would be much cooler to tell someone a lesser known technique like Concept B.</p>

<p>Thus we describe a &ldquo;technical coolness&rdquo; as follows:</p>

<div style="display: inline-block">
<div id='image-span' style="float: left; display: inline-block; width: 150px; margin-left: 50px;">
        <span>
            <span>Regular Arrays</span>
            <img  src="/images/dork_is_not_cool.png"></img>
        </span>
</div>
<div id='image-span' style="float: left; display: inline-block; width: 200px; margin-left: 50px;">
        <span>
            <span>Pointer Manipulation</span>
            <img src="/images/don_draper_is_cool.png"></img>
        </span>
</div>
</div>


<p>(I admit the above picture, taken out of context, is hilarious and ridiculous. But bear with me&hellip;)</p>

<p>This elucidates the &ldquo;cool factor&rdquo;, which is simply the following phenomenon:</p>

<h3>People think it&rsquo;s ridiculously cool to know utterly useless things.</h3>

<p>As a matter of fact, the useless things are MUCH cooler to know than the useful things.</p>

<p>This is clearly illustrated in a few points:
1. The more useless something is, the harder it is to learn and remember (because it is never employed, and is so useless that it is rare to come by).
2. The harder it is to learn, the less people who will know it.
3. The less people who know a concept, the cooler it is to know (because you will be one of the few with this knowledge).</p>

<p>Thus we can conclude:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;People are infinitely impressed by this useless knowledge.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Think about it&hellip;if an idea is useful &ndash; truly useful &ndash; it spreads like wildfire through the industry. Mocking and stubbing, writing tests for large code bases, cloud based storage &ndash; these concepts spread like butter, nice and easy. Other concepts though, remain known by only a few. Why? Because for God&rsquo;s sake, they <em>shouldn&rsquo;t</em> spread. They are utterly useless in all but an extremely small subset of problems, and are not ubiquitously applicable like the good ideas are&hellip;and this, is exactly why they are so damn cool.</p>

<p>The cool factor seems to be particularly ubiquitous in the software industry, and I believe it&rsquo;s one of the reasons we often get people being more desirous of a very depth-full understand of tech. I also think this is a serious problem that needs to be solved.</p>

<p>Imho, the problem is particularly dangerous in the consulting industry because we are not there to show off how many awesome, bad ass tools and techniques we can use. Instead, we&rsquo;re there to solve some problem as quickly, efficiently, and most important: as simply as possible so that code can be easily handed over to our clients. Bringing guava into a project, and upgrading to Java 8, so we can use a hash whose values are functions to solve a relatively simple sorting problem is cool, but is it really necessary? Is it really the simplest and easiest thing we can do to solve that sorting issue for our clients?</p>

<h3>So, what to do?</h3>

<p>Per the norm, exposing and ridiculing a problem is infinitely easier (and less fun :-P) than offering solutions for it. But, let&rsquo;s give it a shot:</p>

<ol>
<li>Control yourself. If some new technology or tool is cool, ONLY use it if it will really offer value in that particular solution. Don&rsquo;t be seduced by the coolness.</li>
<li>Have someone review your code. If it takes them more than a few minutes to understand it, it might be unnecessarily complex. This one is dangerous, because the reviewer very well may say &ldquo;Wow, that is AWESOME!&rdquo; but, keep in mind, this is NOT GOOD&hellip;even though we&rsquo;d love it to be.</li>
<li>Start off with the simplest solution possible. If it works, and keeps the code extensible and easily changeable, avoid at all costs refactoring it to the &lsquo;cooler&rsquo; version.</li>
</ol>
