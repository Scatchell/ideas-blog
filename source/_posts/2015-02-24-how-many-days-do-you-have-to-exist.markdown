Have you ever spoken to someone who says something like “a year is just a drop in the bucket” or “don’t worry so much about just 6 or 9 months”?

Let me tell a rather personal story - a few years ago, I remember very clearly I had a day where I sat around, watched some TV, played a game or two and chatted with some friends. By the end of the day I thought “damn, I did almost nothing today! Completely wasted.” but then I thought “Oh well, I have millions of days in my life, this is just one of them”, without thinking too much about it. Then I started to think more about that number....1 million days...did I really have that? My instinct told me that number was high. Ah well, maybe it’s more like a few hundred thousand? I did some basic math in my head and thought even that seemed high. To be sure, I pulled out a calculator:

- 365 days in a year
- Assumption of living (wild guess) 80 years
- 365 * 80 = 29,200 days
- (Or....under 1,000 months of life.)

30,000 days?! Only 30,000 fucking days?!

That number is so small, I can actually fathom it using every day examples. I can imagine in my head about 30,000 things. 30,000 seconds is only a single working day (8 hours). Yankee stadium can hold 50,000 people, almost double this number.

So, imagine what you did/will do today. That is 1 day. Multiply that by only 30,000, and you have all of what you will ever do for the entirety of your existence.

And that is including EVERY day. It’s not subtracting the days when you are too young to effectively communicate complex thoughts (a LOT of days). It’s not subtracting the days you are sick or out of commission for whatever reason. It’s not subtracting the days you are so old you can barely move, or senile later in life. Subtract all of those, and the number will be so horrifying I can’t even bring myself to attempt the calculation in fear of seeing it.

This realization struck into my heart a deep, resounding terror that is hard to define. I’ve almost died once, when a car crashed in front of me while I was on a motorcycle. I hit the breaks and fish-tailed, couldn’t see anything, and thought I was going to die. It was even *more* terrifying than that to suddenly realize I only have 30,000 days of precious existence before I become nothingness for all of eternity.

That got me thinking about my career. Let’s say you are 30, then you can probably assume you have around (leniently) 20-30 more years in this industry. Let’s take an average of 25. Wait...what the fuck?! Just 25 years? 25 years to do all the things you want to accomplish in your career?! 25 is a number so small I can easily imagine it in my head. It’s about the number of hours in a day - it’s an amount of money (25 dollars) which won’t really buy me much in my city. This number is so small, it’s even more horrifying.

If I held 25 sticks in my hand, and one of them fell out of my hand, wasted, and broke on the floor...I could LITERALLY feel the difference in weight of the sticks that I held. That’s why when people say “a year is just a drop in the bucket” I think “SHUT THE FUCK UP”. It is not even close to just a drop in a bucket, there are tens of thousands of drops in a bucket full of water and I have only 80 years to live my entire life, and more like 25 to advance my career. Every one of those years is indefinably precious, and if even a single one is lost, it is a huge set back that **should** send shocks of uncontrollable fear flying through our bones. The loss of a year is so great, that we should literally cry if it comes to pass, as one of our rare, cherished years are now gone, never to be recovered.
