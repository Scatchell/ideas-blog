The Problem
==========
It all started on a dark and rainy Tuesday in San Francisco (though it's always cloudy, so this isn't saying much :( ). I was at work, right in the middle of solving some mildly interesting problem with a colleague, when I decided to glance at my E-Mail to check for some tool we needed. This forced me to accidentally check my E-Mail, which is always a horrible idea. As usual, there was something there that caught my eye in a negative way, an E-Mail from Charles, written in all caps, yelling at me for not turning in my time-sheet yet. Don't get me wrong, Charles is an awesome guy, and I don't want to kill the messenger, he just happens to be the one who sends out the messages that force me to worry about my time-sheet :).

The E-Mail specifically detailed all the reasons I was damaging ThoughtWorks bank account, and its relationship with Gap, by not turning in my time-sheet on time last week. I was ruining everything....the company was going to collapse if I didn't turn it in that day! And this was like the 4'th or 5'th time it has happened, it was a miracle the company had survived up until that point, I couldn't jeapradize thoughtworks yet again! But, I was in the middle of pairing, and I didn't want to suddenlly leave the warm embrace of my [loving pair](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYBjVTMUQY0), switching context completely for 10-15 minutes while I thought long and hard about how many hours I worked the week before. Decisions, decisions...

If only I had some way to quickly remember how many hours I worked in the last week! Even when my time-sheet is on time, think of how many batches of 5-10 minutes are wasted sitting around trying to remember hours worked? They didn't hire us at ThoughtWorks because of our awesome remembering hours worked abilities, but for other, slightly more useful skills they saw in us. So, I wanted a way to be able to quickly get past this issue.

In less than a few days of spending some spare time, I was able to throw together a not very user friendly but surprisingly useful small app.
