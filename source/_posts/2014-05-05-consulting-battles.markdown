People tend to get into battles over unimportant things. There seems to be some innate facet of humanity that socially mandates battles (and in particular, winning them.)

You might agree with the ?common nugget of wisdom:? "It's better to have two heads than one." In most cases, I agree. Though, we should also keep in mind the ?detriment? of having multiple people working on a problem.

For instance, let's say you are trying to decide which technology to use for a project. Tech "A", or tech "B". Bob thinks A might be "kind of slightly better". Jane thinks B is a bit easier to read but otherwise has no idea what the legitimate benefits are. Both think their own tech is better likely for no reason besides the fact that they've simply worked with that one more than the alternative. Neither of them really care that much.

Now, there is a conversation about which to use. Bob's eyes suddenly light up. He has something to say about this conversation, he has heard of both these technologies! The rest of the meeting has been about things he doesn't know much about, so he's excited to speak up and look like he's doing some work and prove his worth. He pipes in immediately, talking about the few benefits he knows of Tech A. "It enforced better design", he says, because he read that in a blog one time. Jane's eyes light up for the same reason, and she quickly decides to speak as well. "Yes but it's so much more readable with Tech B", she says, "and with a team of 30 people working on this code base, and the strong push for extensibility with all the new features coming in, readability and changeability will be of great significance in this project." She sits back in her seat, quite pleased with all the techy words she was able to use in that sentence, knowing her chances of promotion just raised slightly.

This may go on for a while, the back and forth. Bob and Jane might make a few more thoughtless arguments based off of a heavy bias. They will do this in a friendly, socially acceptable way. No anger, no fear, just two people trying to prove to the rest of the room they know something, and this argument being the only good way they found. This meeting will end and no decision will be made, of course. Other meetings will be scheduled for that. The dangerous part, though, is what comes after this.

For the next several weeks Jane and Bob continue to argue about this ----------------------

I believe this is a common occurrence. When someone makes a decision, they just make it, and start working on the project. But when two people look at a problem, they will suddenly take sides, and become quite extreme about their opinions for pretty much no reason at all. They don't really give a shit either way, but will be fighting tooth and nail to the death to prove their way is better.

It becomes a personal battle of who knows more, ignoring completely the original concern which was something like "what is better" or more specifically "given our context, what makes the most sense for us to use."

There are some benefits to these kinds of debates:

- Practicing dialectics
- General brain exercise
- Team building (if the conversations are nice and fun arguments)

But also has some detriments that really matters:

- Huge waste of time (this is the big one)
- And in some (rather rare) cases, can create conflicts between team members, if the conversations become heated or aggressive.

\* The conversations tend to be negative, destroying relationships, when there is a lot of pressure to get the project done that the decision is blocking initiation of.
