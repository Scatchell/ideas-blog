# Constitution
### British
- Does not have a constitution, but instead uses constitutional provisions scattered amongst various Acts of Parliament
  - Relatively easy to change, needs only a simple majority in the legislature.

### American
- Has a constitution
  - Very difficult to change - no successful amendments since 1971

# Separation of powers

### British
- Has no formal separation of the powers
  - Executive branch (The cabinet)
  - Legislative branch (House of Commons of the House of Lords)
  - Judiciary branch (head of legal system)

### American
- Has a very distinct and lexically enforced separation of powers
  - Executive branch (President - enforces the laws)
  - Legislative branch (Congress - makes the laws)
  - Judicial branch (Supreme court - interprets the laws)
