Ninja Consulting

Some time ago I attended a talk concerning best consulting practices. We discussed the “best ways” for good consultants to get their ideas across. One of the central suppositions of the discussion revolved around consulting “like a ninja” (i.e. transforming the client subtlety). The intent of this blog post is to explain why I think that is a bit bullshit, and offering some supporting arguments for the same.

For context, the ninja consulting concept can be summed up with the following points:

1. Don’t be too direct with the client. A good consultant creeps through the shadow’s at night and quietly assassinates inefficiency and bad design decisions.
2. Nobody ever even knows they are there. A ninja does not run in guns-a-blazing. They are in, they solve the problem, and they are out.
3. Don’t attempt to impress or make a name for yourself. Remember, a ninja is a master of stealth - so obviously their skills not openly celebrated. You won’t even know how deadly they are...until you are already dead.

I think this is the wrong idea. I know you want it to be the right idea...so do I! If only I could live in a world where this made sense. But my argument here is, when we get down to brass tacks and reality (the last place anyone wants to get down to) we find that where we live, there exists a much different set of rules.

Don’t be too direct with the client? Are you serious? I have seen a spectrum of consulting ‘styles’ - two extremes might be described as: those who are experts from the shadows full of unnoticed ability, and those who aren’t particularly skilled but always keep themselves in the brightest of shining lights. In my opinion, the latter **always** has more power to enact change on the client. Again, we’d all like to believe it wasn’t so, but it is.

Take a quick example to clarify this point. I’ll try and be as unbiased as I can. We have two people:

(table here?)

1. Bob
   - An extremely talented developer. 
   - A quiet guy.
   - Has a lot of ideas, mostly good ones, but usually speaks only with his pair about them.
   - Is a bit too shy to speak up a big meetings or give advice directly to his manager’s.
   - Rarely pushes back.
   - Doesn’t speak his mind directly. Often takes several seconds before he can confidently convert thought into speech. 

2. Bob’s identical (but slightly different) twin, Bealzibob:
   - A mildly talented developer. Knows some stuff, but when forced into a corner having to actually write code would probably be a bit slow to get the story done.
   - An extremely talkative person, speaks most of his thoughts off the top of his head directly.
   - Often is the first to speak at meetings when “Questions or comments, anyone?” is asked.
   - Has a lot of ideas, some good, some bad. Regardless of their quality, they are always spoken about to pretty much everyone who will listen, not only including the leaders of the team, but *especially* directed toward them.

Now, which one of these do you think enact more change in an organization? I think the answer is obvious, and I bet you can think back to experiences you’ve had seeing these two types of people and finding that the latter is significantly more effective in enacting change.

It’s even more interesting to realize that one of the key differences between the two consultants is: Bob has generally good ideas, whilst Bealzibob has more of a mixture of good and bad. You’d think Bob’s ideas should be much more important to the client (and they probably are), but because they are communicated so rarely, those ideas are easily overshadowed by others inputs.

Does this make Bealzibob a bad person? Of course not. He’s a genius! He found a way to make significant changes in the way the client operates. If even slightly more than 50% of his decisions are good, Bealzibob’s impact will most likely be a great positive change for the client.

But Bob, poor Bob - he’s been told all his life to be a ninja consultant...he thinks he’s doing things the right way. This is a particularly dangerous situation, as he’ll seldom be motivated to change if everyone pretends like this is ‘the way to go’. When he goes to sleep, he wonders if he should have done more to push this little thing or that. But he finds solace in all the people who have told him throughout his career that it’s good to enact “subtle” change that “slowly alters” the client’s opinion. This is what allows him to continue down the wrong path, trapping him in an infinite pit of inefficiency, forever cursed to be only 10% as useful as he could otherwise be if only he instead was taught to be a bit of an arrogant asshole, and be annoying more often.

Consultants aren’t meant to be invisible and deceptive. They’re meant to be loud and annoying (which as much as clients hate to admit it, is beneficial for everyone). The people who I see around me that seem the most effective consultants are the ones who have reasonably good ideas (**just** reasonably...the ideas themselves aren’t the important part), but yell them out constantly and annoy the shit out of everyone until finally they’re convinced.

Dislodging someones current state of mind is like getting a pothole in your neighborhood filled by the city. You don’t call your alderman once, you call 10 or 15 times, talk to 7 different people, and eventually at a dinner party one day a few of them are talking and one says “God, let’s just send somebody over to fill that goddamn pothole tomorrow and get this guy off of our backs.” Everybody knows the pothole should be filled. It’s annoying to everyone that it’s there, and it’s even a bit dangerous that it exists. Everyone will feel good when it is filled. But still, you have to annoy the hell out of a dozen people to get it done. In the end, we all agree it’s for the benefit of everyone involved.

So, I think we shouldn’t hesitate to be arrogant, aggressive, loud, and annoying. As a matter of fact, I feel we should strive to improve these characteristics to become better consultants. You know how people always say “The squeaky wheel gets the grease”? Well, due to the frustratingly ineffective human nature that defines cultures around the world, if we don’t squeak about the problems that plague our clients, they will never get greased - it’s a benefit for both them and us to be as frustrating as possible.
