Standup

Cucumber - The creator of cucumber (Aslak Hellesøy) has said:

> ...after three days of hacking on my new baby I was on a 3 hour bus ride from Oslo towards Risør with my fiancee. She couldn't care less about programming, but I always admired her sense of aesthetics and good taste, so I asked her:
>
> Patty, I need a name for this new tool I just started hacking on. I want it to have a catchy, non-geeky sounding name.
>
> She paused for a few seconds, then said: Cucumber!

This is the commit that changes the name from it's original "stories" to "cucumber": https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-ruby/commit/a9398c13d5a53b71e582050de92ae49e3524412c

Service

Fork - This word, in addition to describing the utensil, has been used as early as the 14'th century to mean "To divide branches, go separate ways". It was used as early as 1980 in context of the software development industry when speaking about source management systems 'Creating a branch "forks off" a version of the program'.

Branch - Obviously, the branch of a tree, a separate portion growing out of the same trunk.
