What wins arguments? What woo's women? What strikes fear in the heart of our enemies? What gives us trust in the eyes or our allies? What conquers countries? What builds countries? What brings success in almost anything we do?

Can you figure what does all of these things simultaneously? Must be a pretty powerful force, eh?

###Confidence
Confidence is a tricky thing - one of the most interesting aspects of it, in my opinion, is how the way it is perceived and displayed are so grossly different. Those who act confident often are exactly the opposite. And those quite kittens in the corner of the room are sometimes harboring the world changing confidence that the loudest person in the room could only dream of.

I know what you're thinking: "Confidence? Oh yea, person A has a whoolleee lot of that." Well, I'd like to challenge that opinion. Without even knowing the person you're thinking of, I would hazard a guess that they are actually not very proficient in the art of legitimate confidence.

Why do I believe this? Simple because confidence is a hard thing to have - and an easy thing to confuse. It doesn't even take conscious "faking" on the part of the party who seems confident...instead I feel that often it is subconscious in its nature.

Take for example that person you were thinking of before. The one who is very confident. If you didn't consider a particular person before, try to conjure the image of one in your mind now. Let me guess...they are:

1. Loud
2. They talk a lot (likely you think they talk *too* much)
3. They speak their mind without much consideration for the way others perceive their words
4. They often make fun of others without worry of repercussion
5. Maybe they are visually wild or abnormal (clothes, piercings, tattoos, etc.)

I will argue here that this is not what a confidence person is, but instead is even indicative of a lack of confidence. The trouble is, the very confident, and very lacking in confidence, are surprisingly similar at first glance, in my opinion.

For instance, someone who is loud, and talks a lot. This can be seen as an indication of confidence, but it doesn't take much thought to make a counter argument. What if their loudness and verbal promiscuity is primarily based on their fear of being proven wrong, talked over, or beaten? If you were extremely fearful of being beaten in a conversation, one (very effective) tactic, I think, would be to simply talk over the other person, and make it near impossible for them to get a word in.

A similar concept is someone who doesn't listen to the responses of a second party, and instead just responds with what they thought from the beginning of your sentence as if you hadn't even spoken. Think back - have you ever had the experience of asking a question and someone saying "No" in response and then continuing to describe something either exactly the same or very similar to what you have said? This, in my opinion, is a blatant display of lacking confidence. Their thought process, be it sub-conscious or not, will flow something like this: "This person has said something, and I am incapable or unwilling of trying to understand it, thus I will dismiss it in fear of looking dumb" or, at BEST "This person is right in what they say, so I will make a desperate attempt to talk my way out of being wrong." Both have a distinct fear of losing, or being proven wrong, and it is no stretch at all to safely assume that fear is related intimately with a lack of confidence.

Similarly, a person who speaks their mind without consideration for the thoughts of others, without empathy, is not a confident person at all. They are instead a person afraid to empathize, one who finds it infinitely difficult to see the view point of the other party in fear something they believed for a long time will be proven wrong. If you are truly confident, you will have no such fear, and will debate civilly and clearly with the other party, proving your point throughout, utterly willing to hear and rebuke every argument they may have in your unmatched confidence of your correctness.

Think about this in the consulting world. Fighting with someone makes it near impossible to get them to like you (a critically important consulting trait, IMHO.) It also labels you as a whiny, quarrelsome dick in the eyes of your clients. Why would you ever wish such a fate upon your worst enemy, much less yourself? The only reason I can surmise is, simply because you are lacking in confidence, and in a desperate attempt to validate yourself through argument.

A good example, I think, is fighting. Who would you be more afraid of - the person yelling and screaming in your face, threatening to beat you to death, or the person giving you a calm, collected stare, looking deep into your soul with no excitement, fear, anger, or any other emotion. You might think the first initially, but if you ask me, one whose mind is clouded by anger or fear (don't think of Yoda right now, I dare you) is overly excited, mentally distorted (temporarily), and dangerous because they may do something stupid. The one who stares you in the eyes, calmly threatening to hurt you, is dangerous because they aren't potentially emotionally distraught enough to make a bad decision and hurt you too much, but instead, and MUCH worse, they have already decided they will hurt you with a calm mind and are simply waiting for the right moment.
